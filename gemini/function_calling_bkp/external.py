        Creates a customer support ticket in the system.

        This function interacts with the customer support ticketing system to log a new issue
        reported by the user. It captures the user's email address for communication and
        records a detailed description of the problem.

        Args:
            user_email_address (str): The email address of the authenticated user reporting the issue.
            issue_description (str): A clear and concise description of the problem encountered.

        Returns:
            dict: A dictionary containing the details of the created support ticket, including:
                * ticket_id (int): A unique identifier for the ticket.
                * status (str): The initial status of the ticket (e.g., "Open", "Pending").

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the user's email address or issue description is invalid or missing.
            SupportSystemError: If there's an error communicating with the ticketing system.
