# Function Calling with Google Gemini API 
This code is a sample implementation of function calling with the Gemini API.

The scenario is an online retail customer service chatbot, where the bot is capable of retrieving order information from an orders database, and creating customer support ticket by calling an external API (simulated by a mock implementation in this code).

## Usage
1. Get an API key from [ai.google.dev](ai.google.dev).
2. Set the environment variable GOOGLE_API_KEY: `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (optional: create a virtual enviornment first before doing so)
4. Run `python main.py`
5. Interact with the bot!
